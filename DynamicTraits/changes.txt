Researching the Lua error that happened in the MP I found another "Issue" (actually, not an issue but the code was not clean so I refactored it a little bit) with a function and changed the code of it (it works exactly the same).
Testing the changes this time I didn't faced the lua error in MP so it was probably a mod incompatibility and not something Dynamic Traits itself made.
