This mod adds Craftable Magazine Armor for both arms to the game!
This item acts as a shield. Your character will try to block attacks while wearing this.
(Does not protect head or legs)

To craft this item you need:
1 Magazine
2 Duct Tape (half a roll)

Not really planning to do much else with this mod, but there are a few other varieties that could be added such as:
- Ability to use any Magazine (skill book magazines in particular or something)
- Use Newspaper or Journals? (bit strange I guess) 
- Shin Armor? (reduce run speed or make you more likely to trip when vaulting or something)

Just some ideas but don't expect anything, cheers.
